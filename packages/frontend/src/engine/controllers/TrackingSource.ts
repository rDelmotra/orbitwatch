 * The window NavigationController has into the rest of the engine's per-frame data.
 *
 * Implemented by a thin adapter in Engine over the renderers + worker clients, so
 * the controller never imports SatelliteRenderer / DsoRenderer / Sgp4WorkerClient /
 * DsoWorkerClient directly. This is the seam that keeps the camera decoupled from the
 * data pipeline (dependency rule: controllers must not reach back into data/layers).
 *
 * All `out*` vectors are filled in place; returned `THREE.Vector3` values are only
 * valid until the next call (callers copy immediately, which they do).
