/**
 * Thin wrapper around three's {@link KTX2Loader} for GPU-compressed (KTX2 / Basis)
 * textures. One instance owns the transcoder worker pool (created via
 * `setTranscoderPath` + `detectSupport`) and is shared across all of a renderer's
 * texture loads.
 *
 * It also **tracks every texture it loads and disposes them in {@link dispose}** —
 * `KTX2Loader.dispose()` only frees the worker pool, and `Material.dispose()` does NOT
 * free textures held in shader uniforms, so without this the `CompressedTexture`s would
 * leak VRAM on teardown.
 *
 * The `load(path, colorSpace, onLoad)` signature mirrors the inline helper EarthRenderer
 * used with `THREE.TextureLoader`, so call sites barely change.
